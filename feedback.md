# Feedback on Project Work
## Justin Gambrell

In this file, I will compile your feedback (and grade) for your project homework problems in reverse chronological order. Please do not alter this file and if you do, make sure to add and commit the new version to your repository before turning in the next assignment. Thanks, Danny

## Assignment 2

Justin, I'm glad that you started with the paper that introduces MHD. I think that you will need to finish that before you move on to the next papers, which I'm going to ask that you work on for this week as well. I know that there's a lot of reading to do, but this is important to developing a strong paper. Your summary suggests there's a lot of material in the paper, but I didn't see a lot of what you are learning from reading the paper. Make sure that as you read it, you are working to understand what they are talking about in the paper and that you are understanding what the necessary physics is. If you want to talk through some of that, we can do that as well. For next week, I'm hoping to see a detailed summary of this paper (you can dig into this one more if it's helping you understand the field better) and a summary of some other relevant paper.

## Assignment 1

Justin, I'm excited that you are intersted in ferrofluids - the intersection of E&M and fluid dynamics is a very rich one. I know that you don't yet have much of an idea on what to present, but let me suggest that you write a review paper on how these things come about. What is the physics of the ferrofluid? How does it work? What are the mathematical models that describe them. The papers that you have in your proposed list are reasonable, but they assume the reader already knows alot about ferrofluids. I think you might want to start with some of the theoretical foundations of them (called ferrohydrodynamics). Here's a link to a couple of papers that I think you might find helpful in this respect:
http://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.1711103 Also, there's this book that you might be able to find

in our library:

For next week, if you could read one of the first two papers and work on summarizing your understanding of it that would be fine for that assignment. This is a new area and sometimes it takes time to digest the literature.
