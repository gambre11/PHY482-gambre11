# Feedback on Project Work
## Justin Gambrell

In this file, I will compile your feedback (and grade) for your project homework problems in reverse chronological order. Please do not alter this file and if you do, make sure to add and commit the new version to your repository before turning in the next assignment. Thanks, Danny

## Assignment 6

Justin, I think you have a lot of ideas in this paper and it would help you to organize your writing into sections. THat helps the reader know what you are presenting in a given place and what to expect going forward. It will also help you as you write the last draft for this week: what do I want to say about this and where is the right place to do that? Those are questions you must ask yourself when constructing this paper. So for this week, as you are completing your paper, think about organizational structure and how one section leads to the next. Regarding latex to word, you can use a module called pandoc (https://pandoc.org/) let me know if you need some help with it as it's a little odd the first time you use it. Also, I can help you insert a figure into LaTeX if you drop by. Again, it's not hard, but it is very different from the drang-and-drop nature of MS Word. Good luck finishing up this week!

* Score: 16/20

## Assignment 5

Justin, you've made some great progress this week. I think you have a lot of ideas written out, but as you note, you will need to digest more about what you are presenting in this paper. Like I said, thinking about just how EM fields can drive fluid flow from the Navier-Stokes perspective is a good start. That does involve a lot of unpacking of Navier Stokes itself as we as the relevant EM. I'm also glad to see you using broader resources (like youtube to help you address your questions - I do that a lot when I'm learning a new analysis technique in ym research! Great work.

## Assignment 4

Justin, I think you have made a lot of progress since last week. I would suggest that you try to treat next week's assignment as a trial run for some part of your paper that you want feedback on. So, for example, i could see you writing the paper in LaTeX in which you begin to frame the overall topic and dig into specific aspects of the MHD equations that you are explaining in this writeup. I think that will go a long way to helping you complete your paper. You will want to try to get 7-8 paragraphs written up by next week, but you have a lot to work with now. Great job!

## Assignment 3

Justin, it appears that you are digging into territory that is quite new to you. You're doing a great job of summarizing the facts and figures that are coming out of each paper. But, perhaps, we should meet this week (soon) to discuss the paper and what you are getting out of the papers. They might be a bit dense and a little discussion with someone else can be incredibly helpful in framing your paper and project summary, which is due at the end of the week. So let's try to do that. I'll send you an email about meeting.

## Assignment 2

Justin, I'm glad that you started with the paper that introduces MHD. I think that you will need to finish that before you move on to the next papers, which I'm going to ask that you work on for this week as well. I know that there's a lot of reading to do, but this is important to developing a strong paper. Your summary suggests there's a lot of material in the paper, but I didn't see a lot of what you are learning from reading the paper. Make sure that as you read it, you are working to understand what they are talking about in the paper and that you are understanding what the necessary physics is. I think it would help you a lot to take notes while you are reading and use that to turn in a summary rather than trying to summarize after the fact. If you want to talk through some of that, we can do that as well. For next week, I'm hoping to see a detailed summary of this paper (you can dig into this one more if it's helping you understand the field better) and a summary of some other relevant paper.

## Assignment 1

Justin, I'm excited that you are intersted in ferrofluids - the intersection of E&M and fluid dynamics is a very rich one. I know that you don't yet have much of an idea on what to present, but let me suggest that you write a review paper on how these things come about. What is the physics of the ferrofluid? How does it work? What are the mathematical models that describe them. The papers that you have in your proposed list are reasonable, but they assume the reader already knows alot about ferrofluids. I think you might want to start with some of the theoretical foundations of them (called ferrohydrodynamics). Here's a link to a couple of papers that I think you might find helpful in this respect:
http://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.1711103 Also, there's this book that you might be able to find
http://battista.web.unc.edu/files/2014/02/introMHD.pdf
in our library:

For next week, if you could read one of the first two papers and work on summarizing your understanding of it that would be fine for that assignment. This is a new area and sometimes it takes time to digest the literature.
