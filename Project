MY project is going to be on ferromagnetism and ferrofluids. I don't really know what They are so I want to learn more about them.  I know that ferro stands for iron, but that's about it. 

 I have seen videos of ferrofluid taking on crazy shapes. I think I remember hearing that it matches the electric field lines.  I would like to look more into this to see what is really going on and what the limitations of this fluid is.

HW 2

An Introduction to Magnetohydrodynamics.

I was only able to get through a third of the paper.  It basically  breaks the paper down into three sections. The first section is EM. The second section is Fluid dynamics. The third section is combining the two.  In the first section about EM they talk about everything we learned in 481 except they also introduce Faraday’s law which is del X E = -dB/dt.

The paper will continue to talk about things such as what Magnetohydrodynamics are. They are the motion of electrically conducting fluids.  The first ever Magnetohydrodynamics experiment was in 1832 by Michael Farraday. It also talked about how the Earth’s magnetic field can be explained with Magnetohydrodynamics. 

The paper does not seem to make many approximations. It accepts that the computation of Magnetohydrodynamics is difficult.  I would like to learn more about Farradays law to get a better grasp on all of EM so that way I can spend time understanding The fluid dynamic motion.

Lenz's law helps us understand faradays law. It basically says that nature does not like flux and will induce a current to oppose the changing flux.
The divergence of any curl is 0.
so del*B=0. This then tells us that there are no magnetic monopoles.
Thats is why if we break a magnet in half we don't get one north magnet and one south magnet, but two seperate magnets on their own.
They then summarize maxwells equations and note that the divergence of ampere's law is not necesarilly zero at first.
They then delve into equations of current density and find that it is indeed zero.
a changing magnetic field induces an electric field and vice versa.
They then take maxwells equations in free space. So del*E=0 and del*B=0
This is where it gets fuzzy for me. They invoke the wave equation in the form of maxwells equations.
It comes out to be del^2E=mu0*epsilon0*d^2E/dt^2. Same for B.
They then show us that EM waves travel at the speed of light.
Navier-Stokes.
"Forces parallel to a fluids surface will affect its overall shape and behavior.
Study fluids as a whole rather than individual particles. Like currents.
Set one unit of fluid to be a cube where del*v=0
net pressure on one side P=-dp/dx*dy*dz
Complicated equation that says that acceleration is only defined at one point in time for a fluid.
End up with Dv/Dt=(v*del)v+dv/dt
fluids can experience acceleration even while having constant velocity. Centripetal acceleration is an example.
the continuity equation for mass in fluid dynamics: del*rho*v=-drho/dt
∂v∂t+(v·∇)v=−1ρ∇p−∇φ+fext. This is the Navier-Stokes equation for the acceleration of a fluid cube. At least one form.
Define vorticity as ω=∇×v.  Vorticity is bascially a psuedovector of vectors around a point making a circle.
It is like taking the tangent at every point on a circle.
vorticity=0 because of the same reasons that del*B=0.
We can then make a fluid mechanics version of the biot-savart law
Helmholzt said that vortex lines move with the fluid.

Disclaimer: I am having trouble understanding all of this material

Next the paper talk about the energy of fluids flowing in a tube. It gives an expression for pressure, velocity, and cross-area
They then relate this equation to energy.
They then talk about viscosity. They state that the velocity of a fluid is zero on boundaries.
Turbulence is a weird phenomena that occurs at high velocity.
Only end up using three mmaxwells equations. We ommit gauss law.
Alfven waves: fluid in magnetic field bends due to velocity but then bends back kind of like a guitar string.
Then describes waves in MHD

FLuid dynamics is still hard for me to understand. I will continue to try to learn but I feel like I am in over my head.
I have only gone through this paper so hopefully the next paper will come more naturally.

Overall summary. 
Three important things that have been brought up in all the papers I have read in relation to MHD or FHD are vorticity, the Bernoulli equation and, faradays law from maxwell’s equations.  The first paper “Introduction to magnetohydrodynamics” gave a very in depth explanation of what equations we will need to calculate MHD. The second paper “Ferrohydrodynamics” was a little bit more conceptual and did not focus as much on the EM portion of the dynamics.  There are also three videos that either helped me visualize equations or understand definitions. One of those definitions was vorticity.

Vorticity is  w=delXv.  Where v is velocity. It tells us if the fluid is spinning or not. rather it measures if the fluid has spin. That is to say, if we placed an object in the fluid we would see it spin if the fluid had high vorticity and it would not spin if the fluid had no vorticity. Most motional fluids have vorticity because fluids that touch walls feel a frictional force from the wall.   I briefly explored lift but I still don’t quite understand this concept. 

Paper 1 MGH
Paper 2 ferrohydrodynamics
Vorticity can be generated by thermomagnetic interaction even in the absence of viscosity.
ferrohydrodynamics- the fluid dynamic and heat transfer processes associated with the motion of incompressible, magnetically polarizable fluids in the presence of magnetic field and temperature gradients. strong coupling is occurs when the polarization is field and temperature dependent.

charged particles are introduced into a fluid. When this fluid is placed within a magnetic field, the particles slip relative to the fluid and transmit drag to it. This is what causes the whole fluid to move. This is of scientific interest because in zero gravity we cannnot prime rocket pumps. We can potentially add charged particles to the fuel and use a EM field to move the fluid.

MGH says the lorentz force can be nonzero, while FGH require spatially varying fields. using magnetic moment and magnetic intensity, we get the equation. mu0MdelH. M must beb parallel to H. And we also assume that MXH=0, and that the fluid is not electrically conducting. I assume this is because if it was electrically conducting. 

Thermodynamic state of incompressible magnetic substance can be found if we know temperature and magnetic moment. 
Our term from before mu0HdM is dimensionally equivalent to work per unit volume. work per unit volume is also HdB.
The reversible work term for thermodynamic analysis is dW=-mu0HdM.
H=Hinitial+Hinduced. We then say del*B=0 and delXH=j. however j=0 because the ferrofluid is assumed to be nonconducting.
B=mu0(H+M). 

Bernoulli eqn is one of the most useful of all fluid mechanical relationships.  Figure 5 shows how heat addition will increase the speed of the ferrofluid.

vorticity= w=delXv. It tells us if the fluid is spinning or not. It rather means that the fluid has spin. So if we placed an item in the fluid we would see it spin if the fluid had high vorticity and it would not spin if the fluid had no vorticity.  lift on an airfoil.

interesting video showing ferrofluids. no equations but it is nice to see visually what happens when a ferrofluid is placed in an magnetic field.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fw-PemqRN3A another video that did not explain much but seemed to match what the second paper was written about. adding heat to the ferrofluid seemed to make the peaks higher.

Next week I plan to take all the relevant equations and write them up in LaTex so that they  look pretty rather than del X mu0.
