MY project is going to be on ferromagnetism and ferrofluids. I don't really know what They are so I want to learn more about them.  I know that ferro stands for iron, but that's about it. 

 I have seen videos of ferrofluid taking on crazy shapes. I think I remember hearing that it matches the electric field lines.  I would like to look more into this to see what is really going on and what the limitations of this fluid is.
